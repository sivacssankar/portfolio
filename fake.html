            <p>
                The rise of fake news has become a significant problem, influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation. 
                Fake news detection systems leverage machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify 
                and classify misleading or false information.

                This project focuses on developing an intelligent system that analyzes news articles and social media content 
                to determine their authenticity. The model is trained using datasets containing real and fake news, utilizing 
                algorithms like Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and deep learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system can help users and organizations combat misinformation by providing reliable predictions about 
                the credibility of news sources.
