        <p class="abstract-text">
            Road accidents are a major cause of fatalities worldwide, often due to delayed emergency response. 
            The <strong>Effective Road Accident and Alert System</strong> is designed to detect accidents in real time and send immediate alerts to emergency services. 
            Using <strong>IoT sensors, GPS, and AI-based analysis</strong>, the system identifies collisions and abnormal vehicle behavior. 
            Upon detection, it automatically notifies emergency responders, nearby hospitals, and authorities with the exact location, ensuring a faster response. 
            This system enhances road safety, reduces fatalities, and improves emergency response efficiency.
